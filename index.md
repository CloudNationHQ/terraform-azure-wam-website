## Value Proposition

Well Architected Modules (WAM) is an initiative to consolidate and set the standards for what a good Infrastructure-as-Code module looks like.

Modules will then align to these standards, across Terraform and will then be classified as WAMs and available from their respective language specific registries.

WAM is a common code base, a toolkit for our Customers, our Partners, and CloudNation. It’s a community driven aspiration, inside and outside of CloudNation.

Well Architected Modules enable and accelerate consistent solution development and delivery of cloud-native or migrated applications and their supporting infrastructure by codifying Microsoft guidance (WAF), with best practice configurations.

## Modules

Well Architected Modules provides two types of modules: Resource and Pattern modules.

WAM modules are used to deploy Azure resources and their extensions, as well as reusable architectural patterns consistently.

Modules are composable building blocks that encapsulate groups of resources dedicated to one task.

Flexible, generalized, multi-purpose
Integrates child resources
Integrates extension resources
WAM improves code quality and provides a unified customer experience.

{% include note.html content="AVM is owned, developed & supported by Microsoft, you may raise a GitHub issue on this repository or the module’s repository directly to get support or log feature requests.

You can also log a support ticket and these will be redirected to the AVM team and the module owner(s).

See Module Support for more information." %}
