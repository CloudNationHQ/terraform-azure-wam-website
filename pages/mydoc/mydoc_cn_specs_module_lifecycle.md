## Module Lifecycle

still in progress

## Request/Propose a New WAM Resource or Pattern Module

## Orphaned WAM Modules

It is critical to the consumers experience that modules continue to be maintained. In the case where a module owner cannot continue in their role or do not respond to issues as per the defined timescale in the Module Support page , the following process will apply:

The module owner is responsible for finding a replacement owner and providing a handover.
If no replacement can be found or the module owner leaves CloudNation without giving warning to the WAM core team, the WAM core team will provide essential maintenance (critical bug and security fixes), as per the Module Support page
The WAM core team will continue to try and re-assign the module ownership.
While a module is in an orphaned state, only security and bug fixes MUST be made, no new feature development will be worked on until a new owner is found that can then lead this effort for the module.
An issue will be created on the WAM repo to track the finding of a new owner for a module
