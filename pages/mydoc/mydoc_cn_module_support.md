## Support

As mentioned in the introduction [page](introduction_well_architected_modules.html), we understand that long-term support from CloudNation in an initiative like WAM is critical to its adoption by consumers. Therefore, we have aligned and provide the below support process for WAM modules.

Issues, like feature requests and bugs, should be raised on the repo of the Module itself. 
For questions regarding the use of a module, please check out our starter guide [page](./starter_guide.html). 

Well Architected Modules are supported by the WAM Core team, using GitHub issues in the following order of precedence:

#### Module owners/contributors
If there is no response within 3 business days, then the WAM core team will step in by:
First attempting to contact the module owners/contributors to prompt them to act.

If a security issue remains unaddressed after 5 business days, the WAM core team will escalate the issue to the product group (Terraform) for additional support, if required.

Please note that the durations stated above are for a reasonable and useful response towards resolution of the issue raised, if possible, and not for a fix within these durations; although if possible this will of course happen.

#### Contribute
Consumers are always free to contribute themselves, see more information [here](.\module_contributing.html).
