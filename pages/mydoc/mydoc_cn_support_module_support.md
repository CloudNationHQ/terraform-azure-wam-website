## Support

As mentioned in the What, Why, How page, we understand that long-term support from CloudNation in an initiative like WAM is critical to its adoption by consumers and therefore the success of WAM. Therefore we have aligned and provide the below support statement/process for WAM modules.

Issues with an WAM module should be raised on the repo of the Module itself. 

Well Architected Modules are supported by the WAM core team, as defined here, using GitHub issues in the following order of precedence:

Module owners/contributors
If there is no response within 3 business days, then the WAM core team will step in by:
First attempting to contact the module owners/contributors to prompt them to act.

In the event of a security issue being unaddressed after 5 business days, escalation to the product group (Terraform) to assist the WAM core team, will occur to provide additional support towards resolution; if required.

Please note that the durations stated above are for a reasonable and useful response towards resolution of the issue raised, if possible, and not for a fix within these durations; although if possible this will of course happen.

All of this will be automated via the use of the Resource Management GitHub Policy Service configuration and GitHub Actions, where possible and appropriate.

Modules that have to have the WAM core team step in due to the module owners/contributors not responding, the WAM module will become “orphaned”; see Module Lifecycle for more info.
