## contributing

This page provides an overview of the contribution process for WAM modules.

## New Module Proposal & Creation

Each WAM module MUST have a Module Proposal issue created and approved by the WAM core team before it can be created or changed!

## WAM Framework

All module MUST be published as a pre-release version (e.g., 0.1.0, 0.1.1, 0.2.0, etc.)
Consumers should also read the release notes for each version, if considering updating to a more recent version of a module to see if there are any considerations or breaking changes etc.

## Module Owner Has Issue/Is Blocked/Has A Request

In the event that a module owner has an issue or is blocked due to specific WAM missing guidance, test environments, permission requirements, etc. they should follow the below steps:

Common issues/blockers/asks/request are:

Subscription level features
Resource Provider Registration
Preview Services Enablement
Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) configuration (SPN creation, etc.)

Create a GitHub Issue
Discuss the issue/blocker with the WAM core team
Agree upon action/resolution/closure
Implement agreed upon action/resolution/closure

Please note for module specific issues, these should be logged in the moduleâ€™s source repository
