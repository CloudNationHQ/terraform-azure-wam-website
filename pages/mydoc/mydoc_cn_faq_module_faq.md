This page references additional resources available for Well Architected Modules (WAM).

CARML/TFWAM to WAM Evolution Details
While WAM Module contributions and ownership will shortly be opened to all CloudNation FTEs and the public (as contributors), the content of previously existing libraries such as TFWAM & CARML will be migrated to WAM. The relevant teams are working out the details.

Please go ahead and submit your Module Proposal today and just let us know in the details
If you don’t plan to be the owner but do want to contribute, please hold off from contributing until it’s migrated from CARML/TFWAM
